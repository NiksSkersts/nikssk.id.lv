A funny side project/entertainment that I found on the Internet.

Here's original [pdf](/self-eval/system-administrator-leveling-matrix.pdf)

Here's my take:

For first row, I have had courses for LVL80, and for some things (like kernel options) I have even played around with. I do understand-ish the process execution, but I would not use the big word "understand".

I have built binaries from source or adapted them from one distro to another (rpm -> deb).

As for row 2, I have built and maintain my own servers (non-enterprise type). I love playing lego with my computers.

I mainly deal with Ansible for automatization. All my homelab is in private git, unfortunately, I have been too lazy to seperate variables from rest of the code to publish it publicly.
