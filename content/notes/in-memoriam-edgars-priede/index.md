## Edgars Priede (22.01.2001 - 01.10.2023)

Hey, Edgar!

I remember our first date. We went to Tējas Namiņš in Jelgava, where you made your "sugar drink with slight taste of tea." You loved your sweets. We kept talking and walking around until dusk. I still remember our evening chat at Raiņa parks about our lives and education. Good lord, I can't believe you did not outright ban the stuck-up university student I was. 

Remember when I kissed you at the Pasta Sala kids playground? I wonder if the little house is still there. We got caught by a police officer, haha. She was not impressed. I guess she thought we were doing drugs or something.

You moved to Riga, and we stayed friends online. One day you asked me out for a walk again. I didn't think much of it then. We talked about life once more, then went our separate ways.

Hey, Edgar, you said you were fine when you were in the hospital. I wish you had told me the truth. The worst crossed my mind, but I dismissed it. I only found out that you were gone when I checked Facebook after you stopped replying to messages.

I wish I had been more straightforward. I wish I had spent more time with you. You are one of the few people I would love to travel back in time to see again. I wish I had a picture of you - I always took your selfies for granted so I never saved them.

If I remember correctly, you were not good at English, haha. So you might not even understand this if you ever got to read it. Hey, Edgar, Es ceru tevi satikt nākamajā dzīvē.
